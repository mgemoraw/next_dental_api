Key Features of SQLModel:
Declarative Syntax: Define models using Python classes.
Automatic Table Creation: SQLModel generates SQL statements to create tables based on your models.
Asynchronous Support: Integrates seamlessly with asynchronous frameworks like FastAPI.
Query Building: Provides a flexible way to build SQL queries using Pythonic syntax.
Model Validation: Enforces data integrity using Pydantic.
More Advanced Usage:
CRUD Operations: Use SQLModel's built-in methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
Relationships: Define relationships between models using foreign keys and backreferences.
Asynchronous Sessions: Use asynchronous sessions for efficient database interactions in asynchronous applications.
Custom Queries: Write custom SQL queries using SQLAlchemy's core features.
Additional Tips:

Configuration: Consider using environment variables or configuration files to manage database connection details.
Error Handling: Implement proper error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions.
Testing: Write unit and integration tests to ensure the correctness of your database interactions.
Performance Optimization: Use techniques like caching, query optimization, and connection pooling to improve performance.
By leveraging SQLModel, you can build robust and scalable FastAPI applications with efficient database operations.
